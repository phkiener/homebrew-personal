# phkiener/personal - A tap for my own software

I'm too shy to put this stuff into homebrew/core - and I don't think it's even worthy being in there.
So I just do my own tap. Because I can!

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install phkiener/personal/<formula>`

Or `brew tap phkiener/personal` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a `brew bundle` `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "phkiener/personal"
brew "<formula>"
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
